                            <p class="justified">Introducing the new WB, WBI and PBI range of multi fuel boilers</p>
                            <p class="justified">Solid fuel is making a comeback as an effective, efficient and viable way to heat your home. With the emergence of modern   oil, gas and electric heating systems solid fuel took a back boiler for many years as it was sometimes seen as an inconvenient, expensive and frankly messy job although this opinion is now changing rapidly.</p>
                            <p class="justified">Our WB, WBI and PBI boiler models are very easy to light, require minimal supervision and produce little waste. Quite often they can be run in conjunction with an existing heating system so the solid fuel need only be running in the colder autumn and winter months if so desired.</p>

                            <p class="justified">This is a basic line of multi fuel boilers offered by our company. It is characterised by a simple but solid construction at a very attractive price.</p>
                            <p class="justified">All WB series boilers (except the 5 kW version) are equipped with increased fume exhaust circulation features, which translates into the high level of efficiency and low fuel consumption. The body of the boiler is equipped with movable grates, which allow for quick and convenient ash removal. In order to increase the usage comfort of this boiler series, they can be equipped with optional combustion regulator.</P>
                            <p class="justified">WB boilers are perfectly suited for the purposes of heating houses, garages and warehouses.</p>

                            <p class="justified">This series is a development of a WBI multi fuel boilers manufactured through the process of adding an electronic control together with a ventilator.</p>
                            <p class="justified">It results in the extension of slow-combustion periods (even up to 18 hours) and thus it offers increased user comfort. </p>
                            <P class="justified">The control of the WBI boiler series is responsible for maintaining of the desired temperature and ventilator control. </P>
                            <p class="justified">The construction of the boiler also allows for temporary heating without the necessary activity of the electronic system (e.g. in case of electricity failure).</p>

The boiler also includes components to ensure safe operation. Automatic control of operation provides control unit RKP often together with room and SW thermostats. The boiler output can be set in the range 30 – 100% of rated output and in this entire range the boiler achieves the same efficiency and emission limits. The boiler must have operating fuel tank, which can be placed freely around the boiler.</p>
